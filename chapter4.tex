Polyelectrolyte beads in this system are connected by harmonic bonds and the bond potential is defined as 


where $N_bead$ is the number of beads in a chain, the force constant $k_bond = Nm^{-1}$. $r_{i,i+1}$ is the distance between the bond length between two beads and the equilibruim seperation $r_0 = 5.0\amstrong$.
